FOUNDO uses only full grain leather, worked in such a way as to ensure that the grain and natural features – wrinkles, veins, pores – remain visible. Far from being flaws, these nuances reveal the skin’s ‘transparency’, the expression of its excellent quality and ability to age well. <\/p><p>The metal pieces – plates, clasps, padlocks, locks, studs, buckles – known as ‘hardware’ in the world of leather goods, are for the most part exclusive to FOUNDO. They are usually made of brass, polished by hand, and plated with fine gold, palladium or permabrass. Please read the following tips carefully, as they will help you make your FOUNDO leather object a loyal and reliable partner that stands the test of time.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p><p>Protect it from bad weather<\/p><ul><li><strong>Leather is sensitive to natural elements: water, oil, heat, light, and environments that are too humid or too dry. Protect it from prolonged exposure to intense light and heat (direct sunlight, in a window, on a radiator, etc.), which may alter the color. If the leather comes into contact with water, wipe it immediately with a soft, lint-free cloth. This will prevent the formation of stains and blisters.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><br\/><\/p><p>Keep it away from bad influences<\/p><ul><li><strong>Some materials can leave permanent marks on leather: ink (markers and pens), oily products (makeup and lipstick), perfume and alcohol-based products. Repeated contact with raw or dark textiles can also have undesirable effects on leather that is lighter in color. Finally, in order to preserve the shape of your FOUNDO leather object, do not overload it or place irregularly shaped items inside.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p><p>Offer it frequent holidays<\/p><ul><li><strong>To preserve its original beauty, your Hermes leather object needs time to rest. When you are not using it, make sure to provide it with the best possible preservation conditions: a temperate, dry environment away from light, preferably in its original box or dust cover. To maintain its silhouette, place tissue paper or bubble wrap inside and make sure all zippers are zipped and straps are attached. We recommend that you do not use anti-humidity sachets, as they have a drying effect on leather.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p><br\/><\/p><p>Give it the attention it deserves<\/p><ul><li><strong>Commercial care products are not suitable for FOUNDO leather. Instead of risking permanent damage by trying to care for your object yourself, it is best to have it cleaned regularly by our expert FOUNDO craftsmen. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact the FOUNDO after-sales service. With a little pampering, your FOUNDO leather object will become more beautiful and develop even more character with each passing year.<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>","text_size":4,"text_style":"font-heading"}}},"block_order":["a66f2658-41ab-4bc6-a27f-76b372531b0a","bb856f57-062f-4877-9624-d7822b0b0f8f"],"settings":{"width":"wrapper","align_text":"text-left","bg_color":"","color":"","padding_top":100,"padding_bottom":100}},"faq-second":{"type":"section-accordion-group","disabled":true,"blocks":{"heading-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"LEATHER GOODS FAQ"}},"question-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}},"question-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}},"question-3":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading-0","question-1","question-2","question-3"],"settings":{"width":"wrapper--narrow","bg_color":"#fafafa","color":"","border_color":"","padding_top":50,"padding_bottom":50}},"faq-third":{"type":"section-accordion-group","disabled":true,"blocks":{"heading-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"Returns questions"}},"question-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}},"question-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}},"question-3":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Frequently asked question","content":"<p>Share details about your shipping policies, item returns, or customer service.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading-0","question-1","question-2","question-3"],"settings":{"width":"wrapper--narrow","bg_color":"","color":"","border_color":"","padding_top":50,"padding_bottom":50}},"icons":{"type":"section-text-row","disabled":true,"blocks":{"icon-0":{"type":"icon","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-shield","icon_size":20,"icon_color":"#545454","title":"Secure transactions","heading_size":4,"text":"<p>Transactions are handled with bank-grade security.<\/p>","text_size":3}},"icon-1":{"type":"icon","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-recycle","icon_size":20,"icon_color":"#545454","title":"Simple checkout","heading_size":4,"text":"<p>Our secure checkout is quick and easy to use.<\/p>","text_size":3}},"icon-2":{"type":"icon","settings":{"icon_name":"icon-chat","icon_size":20,"icon_color":"#545454","title":"Get in touch","heading_size":4,"text":"<p>Have questions?
